# TCET Linux PKGBUILD
TCET Linux pkgbuild is a repository which contains all the PKGBUILD files for [TCET Linux](https://github.com/tcet-opensource/tcet-linux) Applications and utilities

#### What are PKGBUILD files ?
*A PKGBUILD file is a **shell script** that contains the build information required by Arch Linux packages. It is used by the makepkg utility to build and install packages.*

## Usage

These PKGBUILD files are used to generate ***.zst*** files which can be uploaded to our [package repository](https://github.com/tcet-opensource/tcet-linux-repo) which make the updated version of the package available to all TCET Linux users.
